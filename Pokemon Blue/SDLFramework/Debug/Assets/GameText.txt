--Blackboard--

The blackboard 
describes POKeMON
STATUS changes
during battles.

Which heading do 
you want to read?

SLP   BRN
PSN   FRZ
PAR   QUIT

A POKeMON can't
attack if it's
asleep!

POKeMON will stay
asleep even after
battles.

Use AWAKENING to 
wake them up!

When poisoned, a
POKeMON's health
steadily drops.

Poison lingers
after battles.

Use an ANTIDOTE
to cure poison!
