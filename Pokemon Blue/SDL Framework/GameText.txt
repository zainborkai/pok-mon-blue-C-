***INTRO

Hello there!
Welcome to the
world of POKeMON!

My name is OAK!
People call me
the POKeMON PROF!

This world is 
inhabited by
creatures called
POKeMON!

For some people, 
POKeMON are
pets. Others use
them for fights.

Myself...

I study POKeMON
as a profession.

First, what is 
your name?

<<Name select input>>

Right! So your 
name is <NAME>!

This is my grand-
son. He's been 
your rival since
you were a baby.

...Erm, what is
his name again?

<<Rival name select input>>

That's right! I
remember now! His
name is <RIVAL>!

Your very own
POKeMON legend is 
about to unfold!

A world of dreams

Oak: oh, <NAME>!

How is my old

<NAME> delivered

custom POKe BALL
I ordered!
Thank you!

<RIVAL>: Gramps!

<RIVAL>: What did 
you call me for?

OAK: Oh right! I 
have a request
of you two.

On the desk there
is my invention, 
POKeDEX!

It automatically
records data on
POKeMON you've 
seen of caught!

It's a hi-tech
encyclopedia!

OAK: <NAME> and 
<RIVAL>! take
these with you!

<NAME> got
POKeDEX from OAK!

To make a complete
guide on all the
POKeMON in the
world...

That was my dream!

But, I'm too old!
I can't do it!

So, I want you two
to fulfill my
dream for me!

Get moving, you
two!

This is a great
undertaking in
POKeMON history!

<RIVAL>: Alright
Gramps! Leave it
all to me!

<NAME>, I hate to
say it, but I
don't need you!

I know! I'll
borrow a TOWN MAP
from my sis!

I'll tell her not
to lend you one,
<NAME>! Hahaha!

***OAK_AFTER_DELIVERY

POKeMON around the

you, <NAME>!

to run an errand?

Here, this will
help you!

<RIVAL>: Hey!
<NAME>!

You're going to
POKeMON LEAGUE?

Forget it! You
probably don't
have any BADGEs!

The guard won't 
let you through!

By the way, did
your POKeMON
get any stronger?

***RIVAL_ROUTE22_AFTER_BATTLE

I heard POKeMON 
LEAGUE has many
tough trainers!

I have to figure
out how to get
past them!

You should quit 
dawdling and get
a move on!

TRAINER TIPS

Weaken POKeMON

I came here with
some friends!

They're out for

stay away from
grassy areas!

***TRAINER1_VIRIDIAN_FOREST_ENCOUNTER

Hey! You have

Have you noticed

They can be cut

***YOUNG_GUY_BUILDING_VIRIDIAN_FOREST

Many POKeMON live
only in forests

You need to look 
everywhere to get
different kinds!

--PEWTER CITY--

short, earns EXP!

An outsider is a
POKeMON that you
get in a trade.

It grows fast, but
it may ignore an
unskilled trainer
in battle!

If only we had
some BADGEs...
