***INTRO

Hello there!
Welcome to the
world of POKeMON!

My name is OAK!
People call me
the POKeMON PROF!

This world is 
inhabited by
creatures called
POKeMON!

For some people, 
POKeMON are
pets. Others use
them for fights.

Myself...

I study POKeMON
as a profession.

First, what is 
your name?

name is <NAME>!

This is my grand-

your rival since

That's right! I
remember now! His

Oak: oh, <NAME>!

How is my old

Well, it seems to

What? You have
something for me?

<NAME> delivered

custom POKe BALL
I ordered!
Thank you!

<RIVAL>: Gramps!

<RIVAL>: What did 
you call me for?

OAK: Oh right! I 
have a request
of you two.

On the desk there
is my invention, 
POKeDEX!

It automatically
records data on
POKeMON you've 
seen of caught!

It's a hi-tech
encyclopedia!

OAK: <NAME> and 
<RIVAL>! take
these with you!

<NAME> got
POKeDEX from OAK!

To make a complete
guide on all the
POKeMON in the
world...

That was my dream!

But, I'm too old!
I can't do it!

So, I want you two
to fulfill my
dream for me!

Get moving, you
two!

This is a great
undertaking in
POKeMON history!

<RIVAL>: Alright
Gramps! Leave it
all to me!

<NAME>, I hate to
say it, but I
don't need you!

I know! I'll
borrow a TOWN MAP
from my sis!

I'll tell her not
to lend you one,
<NAME>! Hahaha!

By the way, did
your POKeMON
get any stronger?

***RIVAL_ROUTE22_AFTER_BATTLE
