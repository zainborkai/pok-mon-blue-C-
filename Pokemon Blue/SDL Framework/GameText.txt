***INTRO

Hello there!
Welcome to the
world of POKeMON!

My name is OAK!
People call me
the POKeMON PROF!

This world is 
inhabited by
creatures called
POKeMON!

For some people, 
POKeMON are
pets. Others use
them for fights.

Myself...

I study POKeMON
as a profession.

First, what is 
your name?

son. He's been 
your rival since
