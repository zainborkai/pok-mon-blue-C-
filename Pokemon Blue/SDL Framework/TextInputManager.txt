--SLP--
A POKeMON can't
attack if it's
asleep!

POKeMON will stay
asleep even after
battles.

Use AWAKENING to 
wake them up!

--PSN--
When poisoned, a
POKeMON's health
steadily drops.

Poison lingers
after battles.

Use an ANTIDOTE
to cure poison!

--PAR--
Paralysis could
make POKeMON
moves misfire!

Paralysis remains
after battles.

Use PARLYZ HEAL
for treatment!

--BRN--
A burn reduces
power and speed.
It also causes
ongoing damage.

Burns remain
after battles.

Use BURN HEAL to
cure a burn!

--FRZ--
If frozen, a 
POKeMON becomes
totally immobile!

It stays frozen
even after the
battle ends.

Use ICE HEAL to
that out POKeMON!

YES

Time is money...
Go along then.

NO

I see you're using
a POKeDEX.

When you catch a
POKeMON, POKeDEX
is automatically
updated.

What? Don't you 
know how to catch 
POKeMON?

I'll show you
how to then.

First, you need
to weaken the
target POKeMON.
