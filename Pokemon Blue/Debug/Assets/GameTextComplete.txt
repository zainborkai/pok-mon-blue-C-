***INTRO

Hello there!
Welcome to the
world of POKeMON!

My name is OAK!
People call me
the POKeMON PROF!

This world is 
inhabited by
creatures called
POKeMON!

For some people, 
POKeMON are
pets. Others use
them for fights.

Myself...

I study POKeMON
as a profession.

First, what is 
your name?

<<Name select input>>

Right! So your 
name is <NAME>!

This is my grand-
son. He's been 
your rival since
you were a baby.

...Erm, what is
his name again?

<<Rival name select input>>

That's right! I
remember now! His
name is <NAME>!

<NAME>!

Your very own
POKeMON legend is 
about to unfold!

A world of dreams
and adventures
with POKeMON
awaits! Let's go!

You need your own 
POKeMON for your

<RIVAL>: Gramps!
I'm fed up with

Hey! You came from
PALLET TOWN?

You know PORF. 
OAK, right?

His order came in.
Will you take it
to him?

<NAME> got
OAK's PARCEL!

--Attendant-- 
Okay! Say hi to
PROF. OAK for me!

--1st light haired guy --
This shops sells
many ANTIDOTEs.

--2nd dark haired guy--
No! POTIONs are
all sold out.

--SHELF--
Wow! Tons of 
POKeMON stuff!

***RANDOM HOUSE

--Girl sitting--
Whew! I'm trying 
to memorize all
my notes.

--Notebook--
Looked at the 
notebook!

First page...

POKe BALLs are
used to catch
POKeMON.

Up to 6 POKeMON 
can be carried.

People who raise
and make POKeMON
fight are called
POKeMON trainers.

Turn the page?

YES
NO

Second page...

A healthy POKeMON
may be hard to
catch, so weaken
it first!

Poison, burns and
other damage are
effective!

Turn the page?

YES
NO

Third page...

POKeMON trainers
seek others to
engage in POKeMON
fights.

Battles are 
constantly fought
at POKeMON GYMs.

Turn the page?

YES
NO

Fourth page...

The goal for
POKeMON trainers
is to beat the
top 8 POKeMON
GYM LEADERs.

Do so to earn the
right to face...

The ELITE FOUR of
POKeMON LEAGUE!

GIRL: Hey! Don't
look at my notes!

--Blackboard--
The blackboard 
describes POKeMON
STATUS changes
during battles.

Which heading do 
you want to read?

<<Selecting a blackboard heading>>

--SLP--
A POKeMON can't
attack if it's
asleep!

POKeMON will stay
asleep even after
battles.

Use AWAKENING to 
wake them up!

--PSN--
When poisoned, a
POKeMON's health
steadily drops.

Poison lingers
after battles.

Use an ANTIDOTE
to cure poison!

--PAR--
Paralysis could
make POKeMON
moves misfire!

Paralysis remains
after battles.

Use PARLYZ HEAL
for treatment!

--BRN--
A burn reduces
power and speed.
It also causes
ongoing damage.

Burns remain
after battles.

Use BURN HEAL to
cure a burn!

--FRZ--
If frozen, a 
POKeMON becomes
totally immobile!

It stays frozen
even after the
battle ends.

Use ICE HEAL to
that out POKeMON!

--Teacher--
Okay!

Be sure to read 
the blackboard 
carefully!

***People blocking path

Oh Grandpa!
Don't be so mean!

his coffee yet.

***Back to OAK

Oak: oh, <NAME>!

How is my old
POKeMON?

Well, it seems to
like you a lot.

You must be
talented as a
POKeMON trainer!

What? You have
something for me?

<NAME> delivered
OAK's PARCEL.

ah! This is the
custom POKe BALL
I ordered!
Thank you!

<RIVAL>: Gramps!

<RIVAL>: What did 
you call me for?

OAK: Oh right! I 
have a request
of you two.

On the desk there
is my invention, 
POKeDEX!

It automatically
records data on
POKeMON you've 
seen of caught!

It's a hi-tech
encyclopedia!

OAK: <NAME> and 
<RIVAL>! take
these with you!

<NAME> got
POKeDEX from OAK!

To make a complete
guide on all the
POKeMON in the
world...

That was my dream!

But, I'm too old!
I can't do it!

So, I want you two
to fulfill my
dream for me!

Get moving, you
two!

This is a great
undertaking in
POKeMON history!

<RIVAL>: Alright
Gramps! Leave it
all to me!

<NAME>, I hate to
say it, but I
don't need you!

I know! I'll
borrow a TOWN MAP
from my sis!

I'll tell her not
to lend you one,
<NAME>! Hahaha!

--OAK--
POKeMON around the
world wait for
you, <NAME>!

***<RIVALS> house again

Grandpa asked you
to run an errand?

Here, this will
help you!

have any BADGEs!

The guard won't 
let you through!

By the way, did
your POKeMON
get any stronger?

--When you win--
<RIVAL>: Awww!
You just lucked
out!

I heard POKeMON 
LEAGUE has many
tough trainers!

A TM contains a

A TM is good only 
once! So when you
use one to teach

pick the POKeMON
carefully!

TM34 contains 
BIDE!

Your POKeMON will
absorb damage in 
battle then pay
it back double!
